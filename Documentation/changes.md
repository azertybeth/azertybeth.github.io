installed a new Atom plugin that renders HTML previews in realtime.

created documentation folder in website repo.

created css stylesheet.

download instagram press packet and figured out how to make an image hyperlink to my instagram.

figured out (by guessing) that I could create different html pages for parts of my site and use relative linking to get there.

originally had adapted an entire css code for a side navigation bar, but the usage license from the website wasn't clear enough for me to feel comfortable. instead, I'm going to try and recreate it from scratch using mozilla's open source css samples.

mozilla's resources are sick also I am starting to grasp CSS and actually understand why things need to be certain ways. most of my code is entirely me at this point.
