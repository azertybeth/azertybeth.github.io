installed a new Atom plugin that renders HTML previews in realtime.

created documentation folder in website repo.

created css stylesheet.

download instagram press packet and figured out how to make an image hyperlink to my instagram.

figured out (by guessing) that I could create different html pages for parts of my site and use relative linking to get there.

originally had adapted an entire css code for a side navigation bar, but the usage license from the website wasn't clear enough for me to feel comfortable. instead, I'm going to try and recreate it from scratch using mozilla's open source css samples.

mozilla's resources are sick also I am starting to grasp CSS and actually understand why things need to be certain ways. most of my code is entirely me at this point.

experimenting with basic color scheme balancing in my css before going on to add much more.

checked mozilla to learn how to add link hover color change for text.

watched a video and learned how to write a .htaccess file in Apache to hide the .html extension of my pages in the URL bar.

after reading some other people's code (mainly by analyzing professional websites) I realized that I could improve the readability of my code by using indents (not required for HTML to work, unlike python), so I did.

COOL! you can set one dimension for image scaling to 100% and then change the other dimension and it will retain aspect ratio.

so the thing is, I think there's a more efficient way to abstract out common CSS for each of my pages. HOWEVER I'm stubborn + I think it gives me the tiniest bit more flexibility if I keep separated CSS sheets.

Fixed overflow horizontal scrolling issues associated with fixed position CSS elements.

going to try and scale up the navigation bar.

(NOTE TO SELF: having the text boxes exist under the "main body text" organizer greatly helps move them together)
